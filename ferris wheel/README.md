<p><strong>CSS Animation:</strong> Creating a Ferris Wheel</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I explored CSS animation to enhance webpage engagement by making elements dynamic and visually appealing. The project involved building an animated Ferris wheel, which showcased how to use CSS to bring static elements to life.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the Ferris wheel and its components.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For applying animations, transformations, and adjusting animation speed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Element Animation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Created smooth and captivating animations for the Ferris wheel, using CSS properties like <code>@keyframes</code> to define the animation sequence and <code>animation</code> to apply it to the wheel’s components.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transformations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Leveraged CSS transformation properties (<code>transform</code>, <code>rotate</code>) to animate the movement of Ferris wheel cars, giving the appearance of a rotating wheel. This involved adjusting the rotation angles and ensuring the animation looped seamlessly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Speed and Timing Control:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Controlled the speed and timing of animations using CSS timing functions (<code>animation-duration</code>, <code>animation-timing-function</code>). This allowed for precise adjustments to the Ferris wheel's rotation speed and the duration of each animation cycle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Engagement and Attention:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed the Ferris wheel to draw users’ attention to specific sections of the webpage through dynamic movement. The animation made the page more engaging and visually interesting, enhancing the overall user experience.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
