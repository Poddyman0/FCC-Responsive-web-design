<p><strong>CSS Transforms:</strong> Building an Animated Penguin</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I delved into CSS transforms to create visually appealing designs. The project involved building a penguin using CSS, where I applied various transforms to position, resize, and animate the penguin's parts.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the penguin and its components.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For applying transforms, animations, and styling to the penguin.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Element Positioning:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized CSS transforms such as <code>translate</code> to position different parts of the penguin accurately. This allowed for precise placement of features like the eyes, beak, and wings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resizing with Transforms:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied <code>scale</code> to resize elements, such as making the penguin’s body and wings proportionally larger or smaller to achieve the desired appearance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Background and Styling:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a background using CSS properties and positioned it to complement the penguin. Employed various styles to enhance the overall look, including colors and gradients.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Animation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used <code>@keyframes</code> and the <code>animation</code> property to create dynamic effects, such as flapping wings or a waddling motion. This involved defining animation sequences and applying them to the penguin’s components.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
