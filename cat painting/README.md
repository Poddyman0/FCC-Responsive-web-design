<p><strong>Mastering CSS Positioning:</strong> Building a Cat Painting</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I mastered CSS positioning techniques to create a visually appealing and responsive layout by building a cat painting. I learned how to effectively use properties like <code>position</code>, <code>z-index</code>, and <code>transform</code> to achieve the desired design.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the cat painting and its components.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For applying positioning techniques, layering elements, and transformations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Absolute Positioning:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used <code>position: absolute;</code> to place elements precisely within their containing block. This allowed for precise control over the placement of various components in the cat painting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Z-Index:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied the <code>z-index</code> property to manage the stacking order of overlapping elements. This ensured that certain elements appeared on top of others, creating a layered effect for the painting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transform Property:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized the <code>transform</code> property to apply 2D transformations such as scaling, rotating, and translating elements. This enabled dynamic adjustments to the size and orientation of various parts of the painting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
