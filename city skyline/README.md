<p><strong>CSS Variables:</strong> Building a City Skyline</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I explored the power of CSS variables to organize and reuse styles efficiently. I applied this knowledge to create a detailed city skyline, demonstrating how CSS variables can simplify styling and enhance maintainability.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the city skyline elements.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For styling and applying CSS variables to create a cohesive and easily modifiable design.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CSS Variables:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Defined and used CSS variables to manage colors, sizes, and other style properties across the city skyline design. This approach allowed for consistent styling and easier updates, as changes to a single variable automatically applied throughout the entire design.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reusable Styles:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Leveraged CSS variables to create reusable style components for different parts of the skyline, such as building colors and dimensions. This improved the efficiency of the styling process and ensured uniformity in the visual elements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Organized Code:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured the CSS to make it more readable and maintainable by grouping related variables and styles. This organization facilitated quick adjustments and scalability in the design.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
