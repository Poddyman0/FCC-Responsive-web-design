<p><strong>Understanding and Using the CSS Box Model</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I delved into the CSS Box Model to understand how every HTML element is structured as a box with its own spacing and border. By applying these concepts, I created Rothko-style rectangular art pieces to explore the Box Model's practical applications in CSS.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Used to style and position elements using the Box Model properties.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Structured the content and elements to be styled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CSS Box Model:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized the Box Model's components: content, padding, border, and margin to define the space and appearance of elements.</li>
      <li>Adjusted the size and spacing of elements to create a precise layout, enhancing the overall visual design of the art pieces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Creating Art Pieces:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed Rothko-style rectangular art pieces by applying CSS styles such as background-color, width, height, and border to create distinct, colorful blocks.</li>
      <li>Experimented with different values for padding and margin to achieve the desired spacing and alignment between the art pieces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensured that the art pieces were displayed correctly across various screen sizes by applying responsive design principles and media queries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
