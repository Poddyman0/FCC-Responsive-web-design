<p><strong>Building an Accessible Quiz Webpage</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I focused on accessibility to ensure that a quiz webpage is usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. I learned how to implement various accessibility tools and design practices to enhance the usability of the webpage.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the quiz and its content.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For styling the quiz and ensuring visual clarity.</li>
  <li><strong>ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications):</strong> For enhancing accessibility features.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented keyboard navigation to allow users to interact with the quiz using only keyboard inputs, ensuring that those with mobility impairments can use the webpage effectively.</li>
      <li>Added focus management to ensure users can navigate through quiz questions and options seamlessly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>ARIA Attributes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used ARIA attributes to provide additional information to assistive technologies, such as screen readers. This included attributes like <code>aria-label</code>, <code>aria-labelledby</code>, and <code>aria-live</code> to improve the user experience for visually impaired users.</li>
      <li>Ensured that all interactive elements, such as buttons and form fields, are properly labeled and described.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Design Best Practices:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied design practices to enhance accessibility, such as high-contrast color schemes and clear, readable fonts.</li>
      <li>Ensured that all visual elements have sufficient color contrast to be distinguishable by users with visual impairments.</li>
      <li>Designed the quiz layout to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
