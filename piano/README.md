<p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Building a Piano with CSS</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I focused on responsive design techniques to create a visually appealing piano layout that adapts to various screen sizes. I learned how to use CSS to ensure the piano looks great on both small and large devices, incorporating media queries and pseudo selectors to enhance functionality and style.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the piano and its keys.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> For styling the piano and implementing responsive design.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the piano for different screen sizes. This ensured the piano remains functional and visually consistent across devices ranging from mobile phones to desktop monitors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CSS Media Queries:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied media queries to change styles based on the device's characteristics, such as width and orientation. This allowed the piano to adapt its layout and key sizes appropriately for different screens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pseudo Selectors:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized pseudo selectors like <code>:hover</code> to add interactive effects, such as changing the appearance of piano keys when hovered over. This enhanced the user experience by providing visual feedback during interactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
