<p><strong>Designing a Responsive Photo Gallery with Flexbox</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I explored Flexbox, a powerful layout module in CSS, to create a responsive photo gallery. Flexbox allowed me to design a webpage that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CSS Flexbox:</strong> For creating flexible and responsive layouts.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> To structure the photo gallery and its elements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsive Layout:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilized Flexbox properties such as <code>display: flex</code>, <code>flex-direction</code>, <code>justify-content</code>, and <code>align-items</code> to create a layout that adjusts dynamically to various screen sizes.</li>
      <li>Implemented flexible grid systems to ensure that photo gallery items resized and repositioned correctly on different devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Photo Gallery Design:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed a visually appealing photo gallery by using Flexbox to arrange photos in a grid format with equal spacing.</li>
      <li>Ensured that images were properly aligned and spaced, creating a clean and organized appearance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Adaptive Resizing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Applied Flexboxâ€™s <code>flex-wrap</code> property to enable the gallery to wrap items and adjust the number of columns based on the screen width.</li>
      <li>Used media queries in conjunction with Flexbox to further refine the gallery layout for various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
